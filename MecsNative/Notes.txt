Components to do:
=================

* [x] General vector
* [x] Vector macros
* [x] Hash map for pointer types
* [x] Dictionary for simple types
* [x] Tree structure
* [x] Macros for hash map
* [x] Macros for tree
* [ ] Queue (maybe a version of vector, or extend it, to keep a start index, and cleans up chunks when they are behind it?)
* [ ] Change all structs to use anon types (move alloc to pointer return)
* [x] Mutable string (Vector of char + manipulation tools -- including hashing)
* [ ] Fixed point real?
* [ ] Tagged data format reader for 32-bit cpu 
* [ ] Bring heap in from scan-line experiments

Actor model stuff:
------------------

* [ ] Arenas
* [ ] Serialisation & hashing
* [ ] Message queues
* [ ] Scheduler
