Components to do:
=================

* [x] General vector
* [x] Vector macros
* [x] Hash map for pointer types
* [x] Dictionary for simple types
* [x] Tree structure
* [x] Macros for hash map
* [x] Macros for tree
* [x] Mutable string (Vector of char + manipulation tools -- including hashing)
* [x] Change all structs to use anon types (move alloc to pointer return)
* [x] Queue: Dequeue (enqueue == push). Could do 'push-left' at some point.
* [ ] Fixed point real?
* [ ] Tagged data format reader for 32-bit cpu 
* [ ] Bring heap in from scan-line experiments (and generalise)
* [ ] Add optimised sorting to vector

Actor model stuff:
------------------

* [ ] Arenas
* [ ] Serialisation & hashing
* [ ] Message queues
* [ ] Scheduler
