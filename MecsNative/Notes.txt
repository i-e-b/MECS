* [x] Macros for tree
* [x] Mutable string (Vector of char + manipulation tools -- including hashing)
* [x] Change all structs to use anon types (move alloc to pointer return)

* [x] Tagged data format reader for 32-bit cpu
* [x] String-to-num parsing
* [x] Allow containers to have a target Arena embedded into them (optional)

* [x] Extended data types (vector and hash)
    * [x] Vector datatype
      * [x] vector-index type

      * [x] concat
      * [x] push/pop/dequeue
      * [x] CastString / print
      * [x] Add list functions to main readme
    * [x] Hash datatype (always string-><any>)
      * [x] hash-as-function syntax
      * [x] get/set/unset
      * [x] toString
      * [x] length

This next -->
* [ ] Deep-serialise a tag from runtime
  * [ ] De-serialise into an arena (the original OR not the original)
* [ ] Put all interpreter allocations inside it's own memory

Input handling:
---------------

* [x] File system abstraction
* [x] Improve filesystem to allow non-byte sized vectors?
* [ ] Hunt down and fix compiler and parser leaks (relatively low priority)
  * [ ] improve / re-write the tree container (2-list generalised graph?)
* [x] Convert parser
* [x] Convert compiler
  * [x] tag code write
  * [x] scope (vector of hashmaps)
  * [x] context
  * [x] desugar
  * [x] optimisations
  * [x] symbol output (for debug)
    * [ ] line to tag-code mapping

The machine:
------------

* [ ] Graphics (native / win split)
  * [ ] Syntax hiliting editor (caret in the parser and extended AST)

* [x] Add readline / readkey support
* [x] Performance optimise
  * [x] Special hashmap for scope (like the c# side uses); use array rather than vector.
* [ ] Tail-recursion support (maybe with counting return stack?)
* [ ] Try introducing C++ namespacing?
* [ ] change 'deallocate' functions to `...Deallocate(thing** x){ ... *x = NULL ...}`
* [x] TagCode reader (fix byte order)
* [x] Convert runtime
  * [ ] Add breakpoints
* [ ] Add IPC in/out (vector of strings, or special serialised format)
* [x] Debug symbols file and reader
* [ ] Value stack improvements (delete unused return values. Maybe have a sentinel value.)


Actor model stuff:
------------------

* [x] Arenas (once implemented, wrap the parser, compiler, etc in arena allocater to ensure complete cleanup)
    * [x] Remove stdlib malloc/free and replace 
    * [x] Fix arena/zone naming consistency in the allocator code
    * [x] Per-instance arenas for containers? (so we can be thread safe-ish)
* [ ] Serialisation & hashing (will help escape arenas)
* [ ] Message queues
* [ ] Scheduler
* [ ] Make sure all allocations for interpreter are inside its own memory space
  * [ ] Suspend & resume (including suspend-to-disk)

Garbage collector:
------------------

Might want to use a 'copy' GC, to move referenced stuff to a new arena on memory pressure.
This would save us from having to track anything.

* [-] ~periodically look for 'potential garbage' names in the running scope. If not found, deallocate~
* [-] ~extend 'potential garbage' to hold a list instead of single refs~
* [ ] ensure all allocated objects go into the scope (i.e. child data of complex types. Should get a hidden unique name?)
* [ ] maybe have 'destroy&recreate' for actors?
