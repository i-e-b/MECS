Components to do:
=================

* [x] General vector
* [x] Vector macros
* [x] Hash map for pointer types
* [x] Dictionary for simple types
* [x] Tree structure
* [x] Macros for hash map
* [x] Macros for tree
* [x] Mutable string (Vector of char + manipulation tools -- including hashing)
* [x] Change all structs to use anon types (move alloc to pointer return)
* [x] Queue: Dequeue (enqueue == push). (Could do 'push-left' at some point)
* [x] Add optimised sorting to vector
* [x] Fixed point real? (imported)
* [x] Bring heap in from scan-line experiments (and generalise)
* [x] Tagged data format reader for 32-bit cpu
* [x] String-to-num parsing
* [x] Allow containers to have a target Arena embedded into them (optional)

* [ ] Extended data types (vector and hash)
    * [x] Vector datatype
      * [x] vector-index type
      * [x] vector-as-function syntax
      * [x] indexed get
      * [x] set on a vector-index type
      * [x] length
      * [x] concat
      * [x] push/pop/dequeue
      * [x] CastString / print
      * [ ] Add list functions to main readme
    * [ ] Hash datatype (always string-><any>)
      * [ ] hash-as-function syntax
      * [ ] get/set/length/toString etc

This next -->
* [x] Extend numeric types (use 56 bits of params+data for truncated `double`?)
  * [ ] Handle parsing, including scientific notation

Input handling:
---------------

* [x] File system abstraction
* [x] Improve filesystem to allow non-byte sized vectors?
* [ ] Hunt down and fix compiler and parser leaks (relatively low priority)
  * [ ] improve / re-write the tree container (2-list generalised graph?)
* [x] Convert parser
* [x] Convert compiler
  * [x] tag code write
  * [x] scope (vector of hashmaps)
  * [x] context
  * [x] desugar
  * [x] optimisations
  * [x] symbol output (for debug)
    * [ ] line to tag-code mapping

The machine:
------------

* [x] Add readline / readkey support
* [ ] Performance optimise
  * [ ] Special hashmap for scope (like the c# side uses); use array rather than vector.   <------------- THIS NEXT
  * [ ] special cases for hashmap (most recent n, raw array instead of vector for small hashmaps)
* [ ] Tail-recursion support (maybe with counting return stack?)
* [ ] Try introducing C++ namespacing?
* [ ] change 'deallocate' functions to `...Deallocate(thing** x){ ... *x = NULL ...}`
* [x] TagCode reader (fix byte order)
* [x] Convert runtime
  * [ ] Add breakpoints
* [ ] Syntax hiliting editor (caret in the parser and extended AST)
* [x] Debug symbols file and reader
* [ ] Value stack improvements (delete unused return values)


Actor model stuff:
------------------

* [x] Arenas (once implemented, wrap the parser, compiler, etc in arena allocater to ensure complete cleanup)
    * [x] Remove stdlib malloc/free and replace 
    * [x] Fix arena/zone naming consistency in the allocator code
    * [x] Per-instance arenas for containers? (so we can be thread safe-ish)
* [ ] Serialisation & hashing (will help escape arenas)
* [ ] Message queues
* [ ] Scheduler
* [ ] Suspend & resume (including suspend-to-disk)

Garbage collector:
------------------

* [ ] periodically look for 'potential garbage' names in the running scope. If not found, deallocate
* [ ] extend 'potential garbage' to hold a list instead of single refs
* [ ] ensure all allocated objects go into the scope (i.e. child data of complex types. Should get a hidden unique name?)
* [ ] maybe have 'destroy&recreate' for actors?
