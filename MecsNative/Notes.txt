Components to do:
=================

* [x] General vector
* [x] Vector macros
* [x] Hash map for pointer types
* [x] Dictionary for simple types
* [x] Tree structure
* [x] Macros for hash map
* [x] Macros for tree
* [x] Mutable string (Vector of char + manipulation tools -- including hashing)
* [x] Change all structs to use anon types (move alloc to pointer return)
* [x] Queue: Dequeue (enqueue == push). (Could do 'push-left' at some point)
* [x] Add optimised sorting to vector
* [x] Fixed point real? (imported)
* [x] Bring heap in from scan-line experiments (and generalise)
* [x] Tagged data format reader for 32-bit cpu
* [x] string-to-num parsing

Input handling:
---------------

* [x] File system abstraction
* [ ] improve filesystem to allow non-byte sized vectors
* [x] Convert parser
* [ ] Convert compiler

The machine:
------------

* [ ] Convert runtime
* [ ] Syntax hiliting editor (caret in the parser and extended AST)


Actor model stuff:
------------------

* [x] Arenas (once implemented, wrap the parser, compiler, etc in arena allocater to ensure complete cleanup)
    * [ ] Remove stdlib malloc/free and replace 
    * [ ] Fix arena/zone naming consistency in the allocator code
* [ ] Serialisation & hashing (will help escape arenas)
* [ ] Message queues
* [ ] Scheduler
